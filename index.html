        <ul> 
 <li> Intro: When no one cared about me if I should live or die.</li>
 <br>
 <li> Verse 1:When no one cared about me if I should live or die,
and no one bothered asking why I'd go alone and cry.
When burdens got so heavy that I could not face the day,
then I'd feel His arms around me and I'd hear Him gently say, This is the first line of the lyrics.</li>

             <br>
<li> Chorus:Lean on Me when you have no strength to stand.
When you feel you're goin' under, hold tighter to my hand.
Lean on me when your heart begins to bleed
when you come to the place that I'm all you have,
then you'll find I'm all you need.Sing along to the catchy chorus</li>
 <br>
<li> Verse 2:When the road ahead seems rugged and the path is getting steep,
I feel that I can’t make it and my heart begins to weep.
Then I turn to see who’s comin’ to join me in the way,
and I see that it’s my Savior and I hear Him gently say, lyrics for the second verse.</li> 
              <br>
 <li>Chorus: Lean on Me when you have no strength to stand.
When you feel you're goin' under, hold tighter to my hand. add more lyrics</li>
 <br>
<li> Outro:When you come to the place that I'm all you have,
then you'll find I'm all you need.
